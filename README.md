## AWS S3 Configuration for Image Uploads

To enable image uploads to AWS S3, set the following environment variables in your `.env` file or environment:

```
AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
AWS_S3_REGION=your-s3-region
# Optional: for custom endpoints (e.g., localstack)
# AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=https://s3.your-provider.com
```

- The S3 bucket must exist and the credentials must have permission to `PutObject` and `GetObject` for the bucket.
- The backend will return a public or presigned URL for each uploaded image.
